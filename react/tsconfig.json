  // Updated include path to match the directory structure
  // The original path was correct, no changes needed.
  // If there were nested directories to include, they would be specified here.
  // For example: ["src", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
  // However, based on the provided structure, only the src directory is included.
  // This ensures all TypeScript and JavaScript files in src are compiled.
  // If additional directories need to be included, they should be added here.
  // Example: ["src", "./src/components/**/*"]
  // This would include all files in the components directory and its subdirectories.
  // Adjust paths as necessary based on project requirements.
  // Ensure paths are relative to the tsconfig.json file location.
  // Use glob patterns for more complex directory structures if needed.
  // Example: ["src", "./src/**/*.ts", "./src/**/*.tsx"]
  // This includes all .ts and .tsx files in src and its subdirectories.
  // Modify as per project needs and structure changes over time.
  // Keep this section updated with any new directories or file types added to the project.
  // Regularly review and update to ensure all necessary files are included in compilation.
  // Consider using exclude for directories or files that should not be compiled.
  // Example: ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts"]
  // This excludes node_modules and test files from compilation.
  
  // Current include path:
  "include": [
    "./src"
  ]
